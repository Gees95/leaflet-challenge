## USGS Earthquake Visualization Challenge

**Project Overview**

This project aims to enhance the visualization of earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS collects extensive seismic data globally, crucial for understanding natural hazards. Despite the abundance of data, there is a lack of effective tools for visualizing this information in a manner that is easily understandable to the public and governmental organizations.

**Objectives**

Develop Visualization Tools: Build interactive maps that can display earthquake data effectively using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps.

Improve Public Understanding and Outreach: By creating more intuitive and informative visualizations, the project seeks to educate the public and other stakeholders about seismic risks and the importance of preparedness.

Support USGS Missions: The new tools are intended to assist the USGS in their mission to provide timely and relevant scientific data about the Earthâ€™s processes.

**Features**

Interactive Earthquake Map: Visualize global earthquake data based on magnitude, depth, and location.

Magnitude Representation: Earthquake magnitude is represented by the size of the markers on the map.

Depth Representation: Color coding of markers to indicate the depth of earthquakes, with deeper earthquakes having darker colors.

Detailed Information: Pop-ups on the map markers provide additional details about each earthquake.

Data Contextualization: A map legend to help users understand the visual cues used in the map.

This visualization tool not only aids in data representation but also aims to secure more funding by demonstrating the critical role of USGS in understanding and mitigating natural hazards.
